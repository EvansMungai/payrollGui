**About this project**

This is a sample java project that calculates the total salary of an employee. The program accepts user input for the following fields: employee's name, rate per hour, hour per day and number of days worked. After entering all these fields, the system calculates his/her payroll and displays total Gross Salay and Net Salary with deductios such as TAX, Philhealth and SSS. Only employee's name, rate per hour, hour per day and number of days worked should be editable.

## Calculations
Gross Salary = rate per hour * hour per day * daysWorked
TAX = 15% of Gross Salary
Philhealth= 5% of Gross Salary
SSS= 2% of Gross Salary
